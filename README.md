# Simon Says Game

Simon Says Game is a simple web-based game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colored buttons. The game tests players' memory and sequencing skills as they try to reach higher levels by successfully reproducing longer sequences.

## How to Play

1. When you open the game, you'll see a message prompting you to press any key to start.
2. Once the game starts, a sequence of colored buttons will flash in a specific order.
3. Your goal is to repeat the sequence in the exact order by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
4. As you successfully repeat each sequence, the game will advance to the next level, increasing the difficulty by adding more buttons to the sequence.
5. If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or press the keys in the wrong order, the game will end, and your score for that round will be displayed.
6. You can then press any key to start a new game.
